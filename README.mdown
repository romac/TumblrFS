## Description

TumblrFS is a MacFUSE file system which allows you to browse a tumblog as if it was a volume on your computer.

## Warning

The project is a WIP and currently depends on some stupid PHP script to parse the XML data
returned by the Tumblr API. So it will likely not work on your computer. Sorry.
